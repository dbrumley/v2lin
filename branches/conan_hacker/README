1. main() and user_sys_init()

Original v2linux provided its own main() function to initialize internal
objects. The user of the library should provide user_sys_init() and
user_sys_kill() functions to do the initialization and cleanup of his
application. We decided to change that behaviour to match other linux libraries,
so the user of the library can write his own main(). Internal objects are
initialized by v2lin_init() function, which the user is obligated to call before
any other library functions.

For those who miss the original library layout, and wish to provide
user_sys_init() and user_sys_kill() we give _USER_SYS_INIT_KILL compiler define.
In bash one shoud enter the following commands to compile v2lin with old layout:

$ export CFLAGS="-D_USER_SYS_INIT_KILL"
$ make clean all
